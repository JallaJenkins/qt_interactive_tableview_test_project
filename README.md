A project to test various settings and functionality for an interactive QTableView with QCheckBox items directly in the view.

To be used as a model for developing QTableView functionality in the JallaJenkins/CharacterRoller project.

Also functions as a stand-alone example of a simple coding project that I developed from scratch, demonstrating knowledge of Python and PyQt.
